Scene: Starlite Lounge, a piano bar.  We are in a virtual world -- the scene and characters are well rendered but clearly not real.

A spotlight comes up on the Pianoman -- a typical bar lounge guy, rings on fingers, bald with a comb-over. He has a mid-90's looking synth setup doing drums, strings etc; he plays a shiny black baby grand. Intro to "Starlite" is played with much fanfare. More lights come up slowly, revealing three people at the bar -- an older woman in a provocative dress, a poorly dressed drunk, and our protagonist, Thisone.

_Pianoman: Welcome, my friends, to the Starlite lounge -- where music is magic, and magic surrounds us every day. 
Here to serenade you, I present our little green singing machine. His grammar may be questionable, his hygiene debatable; his ego is quite inflatable, and yet his spirit soars, unabated.

Song: "Starlite"

_Ogre:
It was a starry night
In mid July
We were a lonely girl
A lonely guy
A lonely star was passing by
Starlite was touching you & I

_NOACTOR:
We told the Moon, be still
And light our way
We told the Earth to stop
And hold the day
We told the Sun to stay away
We told him Starlite was OK

_Something is strange
Something has changed
Starlite has turned to day

_Annai: Why are you looking at me?

_Thisone: You look nice.

_Annai: How would you know?

_Thisone: I don't.

_Ogre:
It was a misty morning afternoon
The sun was shining on the bride and groom
We kissed 'till midnight
Danced 'till noon
Under the Starlite in our room

_Annai: I like this song.  It's a bit sappy.

_Thisone: Yes, quite a bit.  Interesting chord progression.

_Annai: You like music, then.

_Thisone: I like some music.  I'm picky.

_Annai: Morashon?

_Thisone: More a -- what?

_Annai: Ack.  You don't get out much.

_Annai: Let's go!

_NOACTOR:
Now as the years unwind
Our love so true
The morning sun illuminates our view
And when it's hard on me and you
We think of Starlite we once new

_Morashon: I'm just saying, software has feelings too.
