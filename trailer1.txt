Scene: Starlite Lounge, a piano bar.  We are in a virtual world -- the scene and characters are well rendered but clearly not real.

{hold=28}
A spotlight comes up on the Pianoman -- a typical bar lounge guy, rings on fingers, bald with a comb-over. He has a mid-90's looking synth setup doing drums, strings etc; he plays a shiny black baby grand. Intro to "Starlite" is played with much fanfare. More lights come up slowly, revealing two people at the bar -- a man in his 30's, and a woman, younger.

_Pianoman: Welcome, my friends, to the Starlite lounge -- where music is magic, and magic surrounds us every day.

{time=50.1}

_NOACTOR:
Here to serenade you, I present our little green singing machine. His grammar may be questionable, his hygiene debatable; his ego is quite inflatable, and yet his spirit soars, unabated.

A small, green, ogre-like creature about three feet tall climbs out from under the piano, picks up a cordless mike, clambers up onto the piano, and begins to sing. His voice is improbable.

_Ogre:
It was a starry night
In mid July
We were a lonely girl
A lonely guy
A lonely star was passing by
Starlite was touching you & I

{time=94.3}
_NOACTOR:
We told the Moon, be still
And light our way
We told the Earth to stop
And hold the day
We told the Sun to stay away
We told him Starlite was OK

_Something is strange
Something has changed
Starlite has turned to day

{hold=16}
{time=145}
The camera careens around the bar, finally settling on the Man and Woman, two barstools apart.  They make eye contact.

{time=161}
_Woman: Why are you looking at me?

{time=164}
_Man: You look nice.

{time=165.8}
_Woman: How would you know?

{time=167.6}
_Man: I don't.

Dialogue fades into the background, as the camera comes back to the Ogre.

{time=168.85}
_Ogre:
It was a misty morning afternoon
The sun was shining on the bride and groom
We kissed 'till midnight
Danced 'till noon
Under the Starlite in our room

{nudge=-3}
Camera returns to the bar.

{time=196}
_Woman: I like this song.  It's a bit sappy.

_Man: Yes, quite a bit.  Interesting chord progression.

_Woman: You like music, then.

_Man: I like some music.  I'm picky.

_Woman: Morashon?

_Man: More a -- what?

{time=210}
_Woman: Ack.  You don't get out much.

{hold=6}
{time=217}
_Woman: Let's go!

{time=222}
The Man settles with the bartender as the Woman picks up her things and they prepare to leave.

{time=244}
While the Ogre sings the final verse of "Starlite", some of the instruments drop out, and the tempo is wrong. He appears flustered, waving at the piano player as he attempts to sing over the drums.  His voice goes strange.  Finally, he kicks a piece of equipment in frustration; his voice returns to normal, and the instruments return.

{time=251.6}
_Ogre:
Now as the years unwind
Our love so true
The morning sun illuminates our view
And when it's hard on me and you
We think of Starlite we once new

{hold=10}

The couple is now near the exit.

{time=272}
_Man: So what is this? A DJ? A group? Some band? Umm, what?

{time=278}
_Woman: What. He's a what.

{time=281}
_Man: Meaning?

{hold=20}
Dialogue fades as they leave, and the camera turns back to the Ogre.

{hold=27}
{time=283}
_Ogre:
Something has changed
Something is strange
Starlite has turned to day

{time=312}
The Ogre burps, then drops the mic, gangsta style.  He scrambles off the piano and exits with attitude.

{hold=12}
{time=320}
Camera shows the bartender wiping down the bar, over which hangs an old, boxy television set, giving the room a blue glow as the main lights fade.

{time=324}
_Voice on TV: 
I'm just saying, software has feelings too.
