Morashon: The Open Source Musical
indeed! say something here

{time=10}

Scene: Starlite Lounge, a piano bar.
spotlight comes up on piano player -- typical bar lounge guy, rings on fingers, bald with a comb-over. He has a mid-90's looking midi setup doing drums, strings etc; he plays a shiny black baby grand.
Plays intro to Starlite with much fanfare. More lights come up slowly, revealing three people at the bar -- an older woman in a provocative dress, a poorly dressed drunk, and Thisone.

_Pianoman: Welcome, my friends, to the Starlite lounge -- where music is magic, and magic surrounds us every day. 

_This evening I bring you a cougar, past her prime; a lifelong alcoholic; and a young man deep in contemplation of his place in the Universe. 

_A perfect setting for the magic of music, which is, as I have said (and now I repeat, in case you weren't listening:) simply, Starlitetm !

_Morashon... oy, what a cad. Anyone remember that getup? Everyone is king for a day -- or is it 15 milliseconds? Shall I compare thee to your previous release? Let me enumerate the ways... and means... Let's not forget the soap!

{time=100}

Pause... All lights fade as a spot comes up on Thisone at the bar, twirling a stick in his drink. Music segues again

_Pianoman: And now, for something completely different -- and yet strangely familiar. Observe, the old standby, when you get right down to it, everybody has one -- or knows somebody who keeps one in their pocket. I present to you, the evergreen perennial -- a Broken Heart.

(Thisone sings)

_
When I
Was younger
When I was much
Younger than today

_
I knew
The answer
I knew the score
I knew what to say to you
or anyone at all

_
And if you dropped the question
I would grab the ball

{time=144}

_
Now I'm
Much older
Now I can see
Things I missed before

_
One world
One vision
I'm not so sure
I can give you answers 
that will fit inside your brain

{time=172}

_
I can't predict your actions
I can't feel your pain


{nudge=5}
_
There's a prisoner deep inside me
There's a feeling I can't let go free
This emotion I used to know
One moment I can't let go

_
Back when I flew wild and crazy
No one ever could stand before me
I used to feel oh so free
Now there's a prisoner in me

{time=202}

visuals?

_
My life
Keeps moving
My heart beats still
I keep pushing on

_
My flesh
Is willing
My will is gone
I can't answer questions 
that don't fit inside my brain

_
I can't describe my feelings
I can't share my pain
Oh oh

{time=239}

_
(hope)        There's a prisoner deep inside me
(feelings)   There's a feeling I can't let go free
(child)        This emotion I used to know
(despair)    One moment I can't let go

_
(flourish)     I thought I could touch the morning
(meaning)   Nothing ever would stand in my way
(nothing)     I used to feel oh so free
(just)           Now there's a prisoner in me

_
(heaven)      There's a prisoner deep inside me
(money)       There's a feeling I can't let go free
(bloodless)   This emotion I used to know
(protection)  One moment I can't let go

_
(questions)    One time when I felt so lonely
(answers)      A miracle set my heart free
(forgiveness) I knew what I had to be
(pain)            I saw the prisoner in me

Man: The only way you could succeed 
was by failing.
Other: No!
Man: The only way you could succeed 
was by failing.
Woman: Really?
