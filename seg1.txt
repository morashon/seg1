Morashon: The Open Source Musical. Indeed! say something here

{time=5}

{hold=25}
Scene: Starlite Lounge, a piano bar.
spotlight comes up on piano player -- typical bar lounge guy, rings on fingers, bald with a comb-over. He has a mid-90's looking midi setup doing drums, strings etc; he plays a shiny black baby grand. Intro to "Starlite" is played with much fanfare. More lights come up slowly, revealing three people at the bar -- an older woman in a provocative dress, a poorly dressed drunk, and our protagonist, Thisone.

{time=14.5}

_Pianoman: Welcome, my friends, to the Starlite lounge -- where music is magic, and magic surrounds us every day. 

_This evening I bring you a cougar, past her prime; a lifelong alcoholic; and a young man deep in contemplation of his place in the Universe. 

{time=41}

_
A perfect setting for the magic of music, which is, as I have said (and now I repeat, in case you weren't listening:) simply Starlite!

{time=57}

_Pianoman:
Morashon... oy, what a cad. Anyone remember that getup? 

_Pianoman (in Morashon's voice):
Everyone is king for a day -- or is it 15 milliseconds? 

{time=72}

_Pianoman (in a woman's voice):
Shall I compare thee to your previous release? 

{nudge=-1.5}
_(unknown voice):
Let me enumerate the ways... and means... 

{nudge=-4}
_Pianoman:
Let's not forget the soap!

Pause... All lights fade as a spot comes up on Thisone at the bar, twirling a stick in his drink. Music segues again

{time=85}

_Pianoman: And now, for something completely different -- and yet strangely familiar. Observe, the old standby, when you get right down to it, everybody has one -- or knows somebody who keeps one in their pocket. I present to you, the evergreen perennial -- a Broken Heart.

(Thisone sings)

_Thisone:
When I
Was younger
When I was much
Younger than today

_NOACTOR:
I knew
The answer
I knew the score
I knew what to say to you
or anyone at all

_
And if you dropped the question
I would grab the ball

{time=142}

_
Now I'm
Much older
Now I can see
Things I missed before

_
One world
One vision
I'm not so sure
I can give you answers 
that will fit inside your brain

{time=170}

_
I can't predict your actions
I can't feel your pain


{nudge=5}
_
There's a prisoner deep inside me
There's a feeling I can't let go free
This emotion I used to know
One moment I can't let go

{time=190}

_
Back when I flew wild and crazy
No one ever could stand before me
I used to feel oh so free
Now there's a prisoner in me

{time=200}

visuals?

_
My life
Keeps moving
My heart beats still
I keep pushing on


{nudge=-1}
_
My flesh
Is willing
My will is gone
I can't answer questions 
that don't fit inside my brain

_
I can't describe my feelings
I can't share my pain
Oh oh

{time=237}

_
(hope)        There's a prisoner deep inside me
(feelings)   There's a feeling I can't let go free
(child)        This emotion I used to know
(despair)    One moment I can't let go

_
(flourish)     I thought I could touch the morning
(meaning)   Nothing ever would stand in my way
(nothing)     I used to feel oh so free
(just)           Now there's a prisoner in me

_
(heaven)      There's a prisoner deep inside me
(money)       There's a feeling I can't let go free
(bloodless)   This emotion I used to know
(protection)  One moment I can't let go

_
(questions)    One time when I felt so lonely
(answers)      A miracle set my heart free
(forgiveness) I knew what I had to be
(pain)            I saw the prisoner in me

{hold=17}
Scene: Starlite Lounge.  Same piano guy (with a bit more hair), playing the same intro. As the piano lead-in finishes, a small, green, ogre-like creature about three feet tall climbs out from under the piano, picks up a cordless mike, clambers up onto the piano, and begins to sing. His voice is improbable.

{time=336}

_Pianoman: Hello again my Starlite friends. Here to serenade you, I present our little green Singing Machine. His grammar may be questionable, his hygiene debatable; his ego is quite inflatable, and yet his spirit soars, unabated.

{time=360}

_Ogre:
It was a starry night
In mid July
We were a lonely girl
A lonely guy
A lonely star was passing by
Starlite was touching you & I

{nudge=2.5}
_NOACTOR:
We told the Moon, be still
And light our way
We told the Earth to stop
And hold the day
We told the Sun to stay away
We told him Starlite was OK

{time=412.5}

{hold=25}
_Something is strange
Something has changed
Starlite has turned to day

{time=439}

We see Annai, a young woman, sipping a drink at the bar. Thisone is two stools down.  They make eye contact.

{time=443}

_Annai: Why are you looking at me?

_Thisone: You look nice.

_Annai: How would you know?

_Thisone: I don't.

{nudge=1}
_Annai: That's right, you don't.  We don't know anything.

_Thisone: Here.

{nudge=2}
_Annai: Here, (waving hands) anywhere.

{time=461}

_Thisone: Then why do we bother?

(pause)

_Annai: What else is there?  To do, I mean.

_Thisone: I don't know -- you must have a life.

_Annai: I must?

{nudge=2}
_Thisone: Why do you answer everything with a question?

{time=475}

_Annai: I don't.  (plays back her own voice saying: "That's right, you don't.  We don't know anything.")  Don't you pay attention?

{nudge=-2}
_Thisone: Try to.  It's hard.

{nudge=-2}
_Annai: What's hard?

{nudge=-1}
_Thisone: Paying attention.  Sometimes it's hard to focus.

_Annai: Huh.. Do you have ADHD?

_Thisone: Not diagnosed, but probably, yeah.

_Annai: They have drugs for that sort of thing.  You should look into it.

{time=498}

_Thisone: Maybe I will.

{time=505}

(music picks up tempo and fades into background)

{time=515}

_Annai: I like this song.  It's a bit sappy.

_Thisone: Yes, quite a bit.  Interesting chord progression.

_Annai: You like music, then.

_Thisone: I like Some music.  I'm picky.

_Annai: Morashon?

_Thisone: More a -- what?

_Annai: Ack.  You don't get out much.

_Thisone: That's true.  I've been heads down for months.  Big project.

_Annai: Let's go!

(Grabs her coat and heads for the door)

_Thisone: Go where?

{time=539}
{hold=6}
_Annai: Come with.

{time=548}
{hold=25}
Morashon is performing in a large venue. He has many heads and arms, plays multiple instruments, DJ's, and sings. His skin is a sickly greenish hue.

{time=574}
_Morashon:
If you try to dance to this
You may find things quite amiss
You may find that things will change in time
Turning sour the taste you thought was fine

_NOACTOR:
I can't tell you what you know
I can't show you where to go
I can't say what you will have to do
I can't teach you how to best be you

_If I say to think out loud
Stars in trees and sunset cloud
Will your brain begin to understand?
Is it just the pair that makes the man?

{nudge=-3}
_Can you hear me talk to you?
Can you tell me what to do?
Can you let me go my merry way
Nothing happens to disturb your day

(Annai is transfixed -- light plays on her face)

{nudge=-1}
_If I let you dance to this
You may find your only bliss
You may realize that you're feeling fine
Happy now, contented for all time

_If I teach you you're OK
Will you thank me every day?
Pour a drink and toast it to my name
Keep my memory alive in fame

_Nothing can prepare you for
What you'll see behind that door
No my friend, I cannot take you there
This is not a thing that two can share

_If your mind can dance to this
You might feel that hidden kiss
Then you'll know how we all change in time
Wind that blows in may just blow your mind

{time=694}
{hold=30}
_Ooh, ooh, changing time
Ooh, ooh, changing time

{time=741}
_Thisone: (over the music) So what is this? A DJ? A group? Some band? Umm, what?

{time=747.75}
_Annai: What.

{time=749.25}
_Thisone: What?

{time=750.75}
_Annai: (playing back recording of Thisone's voice) "So what is this? A DJ? A group? Some band? Umm, what?"  What.  He's a what.

_Thisone: Meaning?

_Annai: AI.  Emergent neural.  Newest thing.  Programmers from Finland.

_Thisone: You telling me this isn't someone's music?  It's not some guy with software or retro gear, uploading?

_Annai: Nope. Code.

_Thisone: Bullshit.

{nudge=0.5}
_Annai: Believe what you want.  Hit the site, it all checks out.  I reviewed the source.

_Thisone: You code?

_Annai: 'Course I do.

_Thisone: I code too.

{time=784}
(pause as the music reaches crescendo)

{time=784.5}
_Annai: Of course.

{time=786}
_Thisone: Well I don't buy it.  I think it's a hoax.  No software package could come up with something like this.

_Annai: Like you said, you've been offline.  Accelerondo.  You blink, you miss.

_Thisone: Yes, but this?  Last I checked, they were just cracking contextual NLP.  No one had shown an integrated personality worth a shit.

_Annai: Emergent, self-modifying code; exponential hockey stick.  Let's dance!
